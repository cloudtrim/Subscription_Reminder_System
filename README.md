# Subscription_Reminder_System
Subscription Reminder System

Problem Statement:
The aim of this project is to develop a subscription reminder system that will automate the process of sending reminders to clients before their subscription expires. The system should be able to send reminders to clients 15 days prior to the expiration date of their subscription, ensuring that clients have ample time to renew their subscriptions and avoid any service interruptions. The system should be user-friendly, efficient, and capable of handling a large volume of subscriptions across multiple clients.

Requirements:

User Management:

The system should provide a user management module to allow administrators to add, update, and delete client information.
Each client should have a unique identifier and relevant contact details, including email addresses for sending reminders.
Subscription Management:

The system should support the addition, update, and deletion of subscriptions for each client.
Each subscription entry should include details such as start date, end date, and type of subscription.
The system should track the expiration dates of subscriptions and automatically send reminders 15 days before the expiration date.
Reminder Generation:

The system should generate reminders in the form of email notifications to clients.
The reminders should include relevant details such as the client's name, subscription type, and expiration date.
The email content should be customizable to include additional information or promotional offers.
Scheduling and Automation:

The system should have a scheduling component to send reminders automatically.
Reminders should be sent precisely 15 days before the expiration date.
The system should handle different time zones and ensure reminders are sent at an appropriate time for each client.
Notification Logs and Reporting:

The system should maintain logs of all reminders sent, including the date, time, and recipient.
Administrators should be able to generate reports summarizing reminder activity, such as the number of reminders sent per day or per client.
Security:

The system should implement appropriate security measures to protect client information and ensure privacy.
User authentication and access control should be implemented to restrict access to authorized users only.
Scalability and Performance:

The system should be designed to handle a large number of clients and subscriptions without compromising performance.
It should be capable of processing and sending reminders efficiently, even during peak periods.
User Interface:

The system should have a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage clients, subscriptions, and view logs.
The interface should provide an intuitive and easy-to-use experience for adding, updating, and deleting data.
Integration and Compatibility:

The system should be compatible with different email service providers to send reminders.
It should support integration with existing client management systems or APIs if required.
Maintenance and Support:

The system should be easily maintainable, allowing for updates, bug fixes, and future enhancements.
Documentation and user guides should be provided to assist administrators and support personnel.
Error Handling and Exception Management:

The system should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
It should have mechanisms in place to handle exceptions, recover from failures, and ensure the continuity of reminder services.
Note: This problem statement provides an overview of the requirements for the subscription reminder system. Further analysis and discussion with stakeholders may be necessary to refine and prioritize the requirements before proceeding with the development

Certainly! Here's an example of a possible database schema design for the Subscription Reminder System:
**Table: Clients**


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| client_id | int | Unique identifier for the client |
| name | varchar(100) | Client's name |
| email | varchar(100) | Client's email address |**Table: Subscriptions**


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| subscription_id | int | Unique identifier for the subscription |
| client_id | int | Foreign key referencing the client |
| start_date | date | Start date of the subscription |
| end_date | date | End date of the subscription |
| subscription_type | varchar(50) | Type of the subscription (e.g., Basic, Premium) |**Table: Reminders**


| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| reminder_id | int | Unique identifier for the reminder |
| client_id | int | Foreign key referencing the client |
| subscription_id | int | Foreign key referencing the subscription |
| reminder_date | date | Date of the reminder |
| status | varchar(20) | Status of the reminder (e.g., Sent, Pending) |In this database schema design, there are three main tables: `Clients`, `Subscriptions`, and `Reminders`.
The `Clients` table stores information about each client, including a unique identifier (`client_id`), the client's name (`name`), and their email address (`email`).
The `Subscriptions` table stores details about each subscription. It includes a unique identifier for the subscription (`subscription_id`), a foreign key referencing the associated client (`client_id`), the start and end dates of the subscription (`start_date` and `end_date`), and the type of subscription (`subscription_type`).
The `Reminders` table tracks the reminders sent to clients. It contains a unique identifier for each reminder (`reminder_id`), foreign keys referencing the client (`client_id`) and subscription (`subscription_id`), the date of the reminder (`reminder_date`), and the status of the reminder (`status`).
This schema design allows for storing and retrieving client, subscription, and reminder data efficiently, enabling the Subscription Reminder System to manage and track subscriptions and send timely reminders to clients.
Please note that this is a simplified example, and depending on your specific requirements, you may need to include additional tables or columns in your database schema.

As an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create visual wireframes directly. However, I can provide you with a textual description of the wireframes for the Subscription Reminder System. Here's a breakdown of the wireframes for the main screens:

Login Screen:

Display a login form with fields for username and password.
Include a "Login" button to submit the credentials.
Dashboard:

Show an overview of important information, such as the number of clients, active subscriptions, and upcoming reminders.
Provide navigation links to different sections of the system.
Client Management:

Display a list of clients with their names and email addresses.
Include options to add a new client, edit client details, and delete a client.
Allow sorting and filtering of the client list.
Add/Edit Client:

Provide a form to enter or update client information, including name and email address.
Include validation for input fields.
Include buttons to save or cancel the changes.
Subscription Management:

Show a list of subscriptions with details such as start date, end date, and subscription type.
Provide options to add a new subscription, edit subscription details, and delete a subscription.
Allow sorting and filtering of the subscription list.
Add/Edit Subscription:

Offer a form to enter or update subscription details, including start date, end date, and subscription type.
Include validation for input fields.
Provide buttons to save or cancel the changes.
Reminders Log:

Display a log of sent reminders, including the client's name, email, subscription details, reminder date, and status.
Allow sorting and filtering of the reminder log.
Include options to view more details or take action on a reminder.
Reports:

Provide options to generate reports summarizing reminder activity, such as the number of reminders sent per day or per client.
Allow customization of the report parameters, such as date range or specific clients.
These wireframes provide a basic structure for the user interface of the Subscription Reminder System. You can work with a visual designer or use wireframing tools to convert these textual descriptions into visual wireframes that align with your project's design aesthetic and user experience requirements.
